+++

This is the very last week to [submit your talk proposal for KubeCon NA](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kubecon-cloudnativecon-north-america/program/cfp/)! We're happy to help brainstorm, review, or copyedit any Linkerd-related talks. DM William Morgan, Jason Morgan, or Catherine Paganini if interested.
